kind: Kustomization
resources:
- helm-repo.yaml
- ../../../../infrastructure/sources/external-secrets-repo.yaml
# Note: In production environments, frontend-repo.yaml and backend-repo.yaml
# would point to separate Git repositories owned by different teams.
# For this demo, we use the flux-system repository with different paths/intervals
# to demonstrate the multi-source configuration pattern.
