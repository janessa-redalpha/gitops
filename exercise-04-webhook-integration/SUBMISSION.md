## Student Information
- **Name**: [Your Name]
- **Date**: [Submission Date]
- **Repository**: https://github.com/janessa-redalpha/gitops

## Overview

This submission demonstrates the successful configuration of Git webhooks to trigger immediate Flux synchronization, reducing deployment lag from polling intervals.

## 1. Secret and Receiver YAML

### Webhook Secret

File: `webhook-secret.yaml`

```yaml
[Paste your webhook-secret.yaml contents here]
```

**Secret verification:**
```bash
$ kubectl -n flux-system get secret webhook-token
NAME            TYPE     DATA   AGE
webhook-token   Opaque   1      [YOUR_AGE]
```

### Receiver Configurations

#### Dev Environment

File: `receiver-dev.yaml`

```yaml
[Paste your receiver-dev.yaml contents here]
```

#### Staging Environment

File: `receiver-staging.yaml`

```yaml
[Paste your receiver-staging.yaml contents here]
```

#### Production Environment

File: `receiver-prod.yaml`

```yaml
[Paste your receiver-prod.yaml contents here]
```

**Receiver verification:**
```bash
$ kubectl -n flux-system get receiver
[Paste your receiver status output here]
```

## 2. Ingress Configuration or Port-Forward Instructions

### Option A: Ingress (Production)

File: `ingress.yaml`

```yaml
[If using Ingress, paste your ingress.yaml contents here]
```

**Ingress verification:**
```bash
$ kubectl -n flux-system get ingress
[Paste your ingress status output here]
```

**DNS Configuration:**
- Domain: [Your domain]
- Points to: [Ingress IP/hostname]
- TLS: [Yes/No, certificate issuer]

### Option B: Port-Forward (Testing)

**Port-forward command used:**
```bash
kubectl -n flux-system port-forward svc/notification-controller 9292:80
```

**Testing method:**
- [x] Local port-forward with ngrok/tunneling
- [ ] Other: [Specify]

**Tunnel URL:** [If using ngrok, paste URL here]

## 3. Evidence of Successful Webhook Delivery

### GitHub Webhook Configuration

**Repository:** https://github.com/janessa-redalpha/gitops

**Webhook Settings:**
- Payload URL: [Your webhook URL]
- Content type: application/json
- Secret: [Configured - not shown for security]
- Events: Push events
- Active: Yes

**Screenshot: GitHub Webhook Configuration**

[Insert screenshot of GitHub webhook settings page]

**Screenshot: GitHub Webhook Delivery**

[Insert screenshot of successful webhook delivery with green checkmark from GitHub's "Recent Deliveries" section]

### Webhook Delivery Details

**From GitHub Recent Deliveries:**

Request:
```
[Paste webhook request details from GitHub, including headers and payload]
```

Response:
```
Status: 200 OK
[Paste response details]
```

### Receiver Status

```bash
$ kubectl -n flux-system describe receiver gitops-receiver-dev
[Paste full receiver description showing Ready status and webhook path]
```

### Notification Controller Logs

```bash
$ kubectl -n flux-system logs deploy/notification-controller --tail=30
[Paste logs showing webhook receipt and processing]
```

**Key log entries showing webhook processing:**
- [x] Webhook received
- [x] Signature verified
- [x] GitRepository reconciliation triggered

## 4. Evidence of Immediate Reconciliation

### Flux Events

```bash
$ flux events --for receiver/gitops-receiver-dev -n flux-system
[Paste events showing webhook receipt]
```

```bash
$ flux events --for gitrepository/gitops-repo-dev -n flux-system
[Paste events showing immediate reconciliation after webhook]
```

### Timing Comparison

#### Before Webhooks (Polling Method)

**GitRepository interval:** [e.g., 1m or 5m]

**Test 1:**
- Git push timestamp: [timestamp]
- Reconciliation timestamp: [timestamp]
- **Delay: [X] seconds**

**Test 2:**
- Git push timestamp: [timestamp]
- Reconciliation timestamp: [timestamp]
- **Delay: [X] seconds**

**Average delay with polling:** [X] seconds

#### After Webhooks (Event-Driven)

**Test 1:**
- Git push timestamp: [timestamp]
- Webhook delivery timestamp: [timestamp]
- Reconciliation timestamp: [timestamp]
- **Delay: [X] seconds**

**Test 2:**
- Git push timestamp: [timestamp]
- Webhook delivery timestamp: [timestamp]
- Reconciliation timestamp: [timestamp]
- **Delay: [X] seconds**

**Average delay with webhooks:** [X] seconds

**Performance improvement:** [X]% faster / [X] seconds saved

### Test Push Demonstration

**Git commit used for testing:**
```bash
$ git log -1 --oneline
[Paste commit hash and message]
```

**Push command:**
```bash
git push origin dev
```

**GitRepository status immediately after push:**
```bash
$ kubectl -n flux-system get gitrepository gitops-repo-dev -w
[Paste output showing quick reconciliation]
```

### Complete Reconciliation Flow

1. **Git Push:**
   - Timestamp: [timestamp]
   - Branch: dev
   - Commit: [hash]

2. **GitHub Webhook Sent:**
   - Timestamp: [timestamp]
   - Delivery status: âœ“ Success

3. **Flux Receiver Processed:**
   - Timestamp: [timestamp]
   - Log entry: [paste relevant log line]

4. **GitRepository Reconciled:**
   - Timestamp: [timestamp]
   - Status: Artifact ready
   - Revision: [commit hash]

**Total time from push to reconciliation:** [X] seconds

## 5. Additional Verification

### Webhook Path Verification

```bash
$ kubectl -n flux-system get receiver gitops-receiver-dev -o jsonpath='{.status.webhookPath}'
[Paste webhook path]
```

### GitRepository Status

```bash
$ kubectl -n flux-system get gitrepository
[Paste status of all GitRepository resources]
```

### Secret Token Verification (redacted)

```bash
$ kubectl -n flux-system get secret webhook-token -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 -d | wc -c
[Show character count without revealing token]
```

## 6. Testing Scripts

## 7. Architecture Decisions

### Receiver Strategy

- [x] Multiple receivers (one per environment)
- [ ] Single receiver (all environments)

**Rationale:** [Explain your choice]

### Exposure Method

- [ ] Ingress with TLS
- [x] Port-forward with tunneling (testing)
- [ ] LoadBalancer service

**Rationale:** [Explain your choice]

## 8. Security Considerations

**Implemented security measures:**
- [x] Strong random webhook token (32+ bytes)
- [x] HMAC signature verification
- [ ] TLS/HTTPS (production requirement)
- [ ] Network policies
- [ ] IP allowlisting

**Production readiness checklist:**
- [ ] Valid TLS certificate configured
- [ ] Strong webhook secret in production
- [ ] Ingress properly secured
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Secret rotation procedure documented

## 9. Troubleshooting Documentation

### Issues Encountered

[Describe any issues you encountered and how you resolved them]

Example:
- **Issue:** Receiver not ready
  - **Cause:** GitRepository resource didn't exist
  - **Solution:** Created GitRepository first, then applied receiver

### Useful Commands

**Check receiver status:**
```bash
kubectl -n flux-system get receiver -o wide
kubectl -n flux-system describe receiver gitops-receiver-dev
```

**Monitor logs:**
```bash
kubectl -n flux-system logs deploy/notification-controller -f
```

**Watch events:**
```bash
flux events -A --watch
```
